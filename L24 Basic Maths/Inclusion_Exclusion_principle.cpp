The inclusion-exclusion principle is a powerful counting technique in combinatorics. 
It generalizes the method of finding the number of elements in the union of two finite sets. 
Symbolically, it is expressed as:

∣A∪B∣=∣A∣+∣B∣−∣A∩B∣

Here’s what each part of the formula represents:

(A) and (B) are two finite sets.
(|S|) indicates the cardinality of a set (S), which represents the number of elements in the set 
(if the set is finite).
The principle accounts for the fact that some elements may be counted twice when adding the sizes 
of the two sets. These double-counted elements are those in the intersection of the two sets, 
and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection.
