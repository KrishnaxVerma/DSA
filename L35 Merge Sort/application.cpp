/*
Sorting large datasets: Merge sort is particularly well-suited for 
sorting large datasets due to its guaranteed worst-case 
time complexity of O(n log n).

External sorting: Merge sort is commonly used in external sorting,
 where the data to be sorted is too large to fit into memory.

Custom sorting: Merge sort can be adapted to handle different input 
distributions, such as partially sorted, nearly sorted, or completely unsorted data.
